""" WHAT IS BODY MASS INDEX ?
    
    BMI is a measure of relative weight based on an individualâ€™s mass and height.
    Today, Body Mass Index is commonly used to classify people as underweight, overweight, and even with obesity.
    Also, it is adopted by countries to promote healthy eating.
    
    BMI can be considered as an alternative for direct measurements of body fat.
    Besides, BMI is an inexpensive and easy-to-perform method of screening for weight classes that may cause health problems."""
